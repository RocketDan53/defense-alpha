## Market Benchmarks

### Capital Raised

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Median total raised** | **$11.2M** |
| Mean total raised | $48.7M |
| 25th percentile | $4.4M |
| 75th percentile | $48.3M |
| Range | $250K — $480M |
| **Median first raise** | **$4.4M** |
| Mean first raise | $9.3M |
| Range (first raise) | $11K — $69.4M |

### Timing: Phase II to First Raise

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Companies that raised BEFORE Phase II | 23 of 43 (53%) |
| Companies that raised AFTER Phase II | 18 of 43 (42%) |
| Median gap (post-P2 raisers) | **20 months** |
| Mean gap (post-P2 raisers) | 29.8 months |
| Range | 1 — 113 months |

**Key insight:** Over half of these companies raised private capital *before* their first Phase II. This suggests that for space companies, SBIR Phase I activity (or even the technology thesis alone) is often sufficient for a VC raise — Phase II validates but isn't a prerequisite.

### SBIR Depth at Time of First Raise

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median SBIRs at first raise | 3 |
| Mean SBIRs at first raise | 4.4 |
| Median Phase IIs at first raise | 0 |
| Mean Phase IIs at first raise | 1.0 |

**Key insight:** The median company raised private capital with only 3 SBIRs and *zero* Phase IIs at the time. Scout Space, with 8 SBIRs and 4 Phase IIs, is significantly deeper into SBIR validation than the median at time of raise.

### Contract Traction and Capital Raised

| Segment | Count | Median Raised | Mean Raised |
|---------|------:|-------------:|------------:|
| With production contracts | 8/43 | $37.3M | $89.8M |
| Without production contracts | 35/43 | $7.5M | $39.3M |

**Key insight:** Companies with at least one production contract raised 5x the median of those without. Scout Space's $3.25M Air Force contract puts it in the minority (19%) that had contract traction — historically correlated with substantially larger raises.

### What Differentiates Bigger Raises?

| Metric | Top Half (n=21, median $48.3M) | Bottom Half (n=22, median $5.4M) |
|--------|-----:|-----:|
| Avg SBIRs | 6.1 | 6.0 |
| Avg Phase IIs | 3.1 | 2.6 |
| Avg SBIR value | $7.5M | $3.8M |
| Avg contracts | 0.3 | 0.0 |
| Avg contract value | $3.5M | $409K |
| Avg tailwind | 0.605 | 0.577 |

**Key findings:**
1. **SBIR count alone doesn't differentiate** — both halves averaged ~6 SBIRs
2. **SBIR dollar value matters** — top half had 2x the SBIR dollar volume ($7.5M vs $3.8M)
3. **Contract traction is the clearest differentiator** — top half had 8.6x the contract value
4. **Policy tailwind modestly favors top half** but isn't the primary driver

## Top 10 Closest Comparables to Scout Space

Ranked by profile similarity (SBIR depth, Phase II count, space resilience score, tailwind, contract traction, SBIR dollar value).

### 1. Trans Astronautica Corporation
- **Profile:** 8 SBIRs (4 P1, 4 P2), $5.4M SBIR value — **nearest match to Scout Space's exact profile**
- **Raised:** $3.1M (single round, July 2021)
- **Timing:** Raised 19 months before first Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Closest structural match but weaker outcome — no contracts, modest raise. Scout Space's contract traction and higher SBIR value suggest upside beyond this comp.

### 2. Atomos Nuclear and Space Corporation
- **Profile:** 8 SBIRs (5 P1, 3 P2), $5.3M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $18.3M total (first $2.1M, May 2021)
- **Timing:** First raise 21 months before Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Same SBIR count as Scout but raised early on team/thesis, then scaled capital. Demonstrates the multi-round trajectory from a similar starting point.

### 3. Lux Semiconductors Inc
- **Profile:** 5 SBIRs (1 P1, 4 P2), $5.0M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $4.4M total, 10 months after first Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Similar P2 depth and waited for P2 validation before raising — the closest analogy to Scout Space's "raise after P2" pattern.

### 4. K2 Space Corporation
- **Profile:** 9 SBIRs (4 P1, 5 P2), $9.5M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $8.9M total
- **Timing:** Raised before Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Higher SBIR value than Scout. space_resilience 0.9. Still in early capital stages — suggests a raise in the $5-10M range is achievable at Scout's profile.

### 5. Outpost Technologies Corp
- **Profile:** 8 SBIRs (6 P1, 2 P2), $3.7M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $7.1M (single round)
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Same SBIR count, lower P2 depth and lower SBIR value than Scout. Still raised $7.1M. Scout's deeper P2 portfolio and contract should support a stronger round.

### 6. Lunar Outpost Inc
- **Profile:** 11 SBIRs (6 P1, 5 P2), $9.3M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $23.6M total (first $12.1M)
- **Timing:** 37 months after Phase II
- **Contracts:** 1 ($7.4M)
- **Assessment:** **Best outcome comp** — slightly deeper SBIR portfolio + contract traction led to meaningful capital. Shows what SBIR-to-contract transition unlocks in terms of raise magnitude.

### 7. Cognitive Space Inc
- **Profile:** 5 SBIRs (2 P1, 3 P2), $4.5M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $7.5M total (first $5.7M), 18 months after Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Demonstrates the "Phase II → patience → $5-7M first raise" pattern. Scout Space has more SBIR depth AND a contract, so should exceed this comp.

### 8. Turion Space Corp
- **Profile:** 12 SBIRs (7 P1, 5 P2), $9.3M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $15.5M total
- **Contracts:** 1 ($8.0M)
- **Assessment:** Deeper portfolio, contract traction, similar trajectory. Scout may be an earlier-stage version of this path.

### 9. EnduraLock LLC
- **Profile:** 11 SBIRs (5 P1, 6 P2), $7.2M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $701K, 27 months after Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** Cautionary comp — deep SBIR portfolio but tiny raise. Suggests that SBIR depth alone without narrative/market timing isn't sufficient.

### 10. Aerocine Ventures Inc
- **Profile:** 6 SBIRs (0 P1, 6 P2), $5.8M SBIR value
- **Raised:** $5.7M total, 22 months after Phase II
- **Contracts:** None
- **Assessment:** All-P2 company. 22-month post-P2 timing is instructive — Scout is ~31 months post-first-P2 now.

## Narrative Briefing

**Scout Space's profile most closely resembles Trans Astronautica, Atomos Nuclear, and K2 Space at similar stages** — all in the 8-9 SBIR range with strong space resilience scores. What separates Scout Space from the pack is the combination of three factors that rarely appear together at this stage:

**1. Deep and balanced SBIR portfolio.** 8 awards with a 50/50 Phase I/II split is unusually disciplined. The median comparable had only 3 SBIRs and zero Phase IIs at time of first raise. Scout Space is well past the "SBIR-as-proof-of-concept" stage — this is a company the Air Force keeps funding.

**2. Contract traction.** Scout Space has a $3.25M Air Force production contract. Only 8 of 43 comparables (19%) had any production contract at all. Those 8 raised a median of $37.3M — 5x the median of those without contracts. The contract isn't just revenue; it's the strongest signal that the DoD sees production potential.

**3. Policy tailwind alignment.** At 0.9 space resilience and 0.712 policy tailwind, Scout Space sits in the top tier of NDS alignment. Space domain awareness is a named priority in the current budget cycle, and the company's optical tracking and counterspace work maps directly to it.

**What the data says about raise expectations:**

- The **floor case** is $3-5M — comparable to Trans Astronautica and Cognitive Space, companies with similar profiles but no contract traction.
- The **base case** is $7-12M — comparable to K2 Space, Outpost Technologies, and Kayhan Space, companies with similar SBIR depth and space focus.
- The **upside case** is $15-25M — comparable to Turion Space and Lunar Outpost, the two closest comps that combined SBIR depth with contract traction and raised meaningfully more.

**The timing question:** Scout Space's first Phase II was July 2022 — 31 months ago. Among comparables that raised after Phase II, the median gap was 20 months. Scout Space is past the typical window, which means either (a) it's overdue and the next raise should come soon, or (b) the company has been self-funding via SBIR/contracts and will raise from a position of strength rather than necessity. Given $6.47M in SBIR value plus $3.25M in contracts (~$9.7M total government revenue), option (b) is plausible and arguably more attractive to investors.

**The key question for due diligence** is whether Scout Space's contract traction will follow the pattern of Lunar Outpost (SBIR → contract → $12M first raise → $23.6M total) or Starfish Space (deep SBIR → contract → $50.9M total). Both are realistic trajectories given the profile.

**Bottom line:** Scout Space is in the top quartile of SBIR-origin space companies by readiness indicators. The 4 Phase IIs, $3.25M production contract, and 0.9 space resilience score put it ahead of where most comparables stood when they first raised. A $7-15M raise would be consistent with the data. The contract traction is the most important signal — historically, it's the clearest differentiator between companies that raised $5-10M and those that raised $20M+.
