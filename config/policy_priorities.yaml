# =============================================================================
# GEOGRAPHIC/STRATEGIC MODIFIERS
# =============================================================================
# These are boolean tags applied alongside priority scores.
# Not weighted - used for filtering and segmentation.

modifiers:

  pacific_relevance:
    description: >
      Technology directly applicable to Indo-Pacific operations and
      China pacing competition. Includes: long-range precision strike,
      A2/AD counter-capabilities, distributed maritime operations,
      contested Pacific logistics, Taiwan contingency support.
    usage: "Tag companies whose SBIR work explicitly addresses Pacific scenarios or China threat."
    filter_only: true
    notes: >
      Replaces standalone 'china_pacing' priority. Pacific relevance is a
      modifier that can apply to ANY priority area (autonomous systems for
      Pacific ops, space for Pacific ISR, etc.) rather than a weighted category.

  nato_interoperability:
    description: >
      Technologies that enhance interoperability with NATO allies,
      European defense integration, or Ukraine support.
    usage: "Tag companies with explicit NATO/allied integration focus."
    filter_only: true

  arctic_operations:
    description: >
      Technologies for Arctic/cold weather operations, great power
      competition in polar regions.
    usage: "Tag companies with Arctic-specific capabilities."
    filter_only: true

# SCORING GUIDANCE
# =============================================================================

scoring:
  scale: "0.0 to 1.0"
  thresholds:
    none: 0.0           # No relevance to this priority
    tangential: 0.1-0.3 # General-purpose tech that could apply
    moderate: 0.4-0.6   # Some awards clearly relevant
    strong: 0.7-0.8     # Multiple awards directly address priority
    core_focus: 0.9-1.0 # Company's primary work IS this priority

  guidance: |
    Be conservative - only score high if SBIR titles clearly demonstrate
    direct relevance. A company building general software tools should
    score low on most areas. A company building hypersonic thermal
    protection should score high on hypersonics, low elsewhere.

  policy_tailwind_calculation: |
    Composite score = sum(priority_score * priority_weight) / sum(weights)
    Normalized to 0-1 scale. Higher = better alignment with growth areas.
    A company scoring high on hypersonics (weight 0.57) contributes less
    to policy_tailwind than one scoring high on space (weight 1.38).
